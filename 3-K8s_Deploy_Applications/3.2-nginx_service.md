# Nginx Service

## Creating nginx Service

- Two ways to create Deployments:
    1. Write from scratch
    2. Copy example file from [K8s Docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)

- Using an IDE (VsCode) edit your deployment file in yaml
- Copy and create the file on master node
  - Ports in Service and Pod
    - The "port" key is for communicating with the service
    - The "targetPort" key is for the container port (must match)
  - You can connect the service to the pod you want with "labels and selectors".
    - Use selector with the same name of the app used in the deployment to attach service to that pod/deployment.
- run on Master Node: ```kubectl apply -f <service_file_name.yaml>```
- You can view the service with ```kubectl get service or svc```
- You can fetch detailed information with ```kubectl describe [component type] [name]```
- To view Endpoints ```kubectl get ep```

### Who manages the Endpoint Service?

- Remember!!
  - Service is not a process running on the Nodes
  - It is a virtual IP address accessible throughout the cluster
- A request hits the K8s Service then Kube Proxy forwards the request to the pod described in the service yaml file.
  - Kube Proxy is responsible for maintaining the list of service IPs and corresponding Pod IPs.
