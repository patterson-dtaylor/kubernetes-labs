# Deploying Nginx

## Creating nginx Deployment

- Two ways to create Deployments:
    1. Write from scratch
    2. Copy example file from [K8s Docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)

- Using an IDE (VsCode) edit your deployment file in yaml
- Copy and create the file on master node
- run on Master Node: ```kubectl apply -f <deployment_file_name.yaml>```
