# K8s Labels

## Use Cases of using Labels

- Label to identify and target any K8s component:
  - Deployment
  - Service
  - Config Map
  - Secrets
  - Pods
- These are optional, but best practice.
- You can view labels with the following command:
  - ```kubectl get svc --show-labels```
  - ```kubectl get deployment --show-labels```
- You can get the service from the label rather than the name:
  - ```kubectl get svc -l app=<name of app>```
  - ```kubectl get pod -l app=<name of app>```
- K8s will also assign labels to pods and nodes when creating these components to differentiate between components.
  - To view these:
    - ```kubectl get pod -n kube-system --show-labels```
    - ```kubectl get node --show-labels```
