# Managing K8s Resources with kubectl and config file

## Recap

- K8s Components:
  - Pod = abstraction of containers
  - Service = communication between pods
  - Ingress = routes outside traffic to the cluster
  - ConfigMap = external configuration
  - Secret = external configuration for sensitive info
  - Volume = data persistence
  - Deployment = replication of non-database clusters
  - StatefulSet = replication of database clusters

## How to manage K8s components?

- Two options
  - Kubernetes CLI: ```kubectl```
    - Examples:
      - ```kubectl create deployment mydepl```
      - ```kubectl create statefulset myst```
      - ```kubectl create service mysvc```
      - ```kubectl create <objecttype> <instancename>```
      - ```kubectl delete <objecttype>/<instancename>```
      - ```kubectl get ...``` (basic information)
      - ```kubectl describe ...``` aggregated detailed information
      - ```kubectl logs ...``` logs of containers or pods
    - Very powerful CLI tool that enables interactions with the cluster
    - Limitation when using those commands when it comes to more complex configurations.
  - K8s Configuration File:
    - Written in YAML
    - Basically, you write all of the components you want in the config file and then apply the configuration file with ```kubectl```
      - Example:
        - ```kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml```
    - Multiple K8s components in one configuration file
    - You can update the K8s components by editing the config file and apply again.
    - You can also delete components with config file:
      - Example:
        - ```kubectl delete -f nginx-deployment.yaml```
    - Config files are also called K8s Manifest

## Imperative vs Declarative

- Imperative:
  - Uses ```kubectl``` to tell k8s what to do.
  - Operates directly on live objects
- Declarative:
  - Uses k8s manifest to tell k8s what we want as the end result
  - Operates on objects in the config file
  - Doesn't define operations, these are automatically detected by ```kubectl```

### Which one to use?

| Imperative | Declarative |
| ---        | ---        |
| - Practical when testing | - History of configurations |
| - For quick one-off tasks | - Helps with IaC in Git or Terraform|
| - For getting started | - Collaboration and review processes are possible |
| | - More transparent|
