# K8s Configuration File

## 3 Parts of Config File

1. metadata
   1. Name of component
2. specification
   1. Every configuration of what you want
   2. Attributes of "spec" are specific to the "kind"
      1. Deployment will have it's own "specs" as will Service
3. status
   1. Automatically generated and added by K8s
   2. K8s looks at what is the desired state vs the actual state of the cluster.
   3. If the desired state does not match the actual state, K8s will self-heal itself to get the desired and actual states to match.
   4. So, let's say that the desired state has 2 replicas, but the actual state only has 1 replica. K8s will compare the desired state against the actual state using the "etcd" and create the 2nd replica.

## Format of K8s Config File
