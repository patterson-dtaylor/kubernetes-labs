# TLS Cert

- Establishes secure connection from client to server.
- Sensitive data must be secure over a connection
- A hacker can use MITM attack to get user creds.
- TLS encrypts data over a connection
- Uses asymmetric key pair to encrypt data to the server.
- Hackers can use phishing techniques to establish a secure connection using a fake website.
- The cert comes from CA that issues digital certs of ownership and prove that their website is used by the owner of the server.
- Servers also need to validate the client cert before creating a secure connection.
