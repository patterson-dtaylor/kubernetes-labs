# K8s Networking

## Container Communication

- Pods
  - Solves the port allocation problem
    - port 
  - Every pod has a unique IP address
    - The IP is reachable from all other Pods in the K8s cluster
  - Each pod gets its own network namespace and virtual ethernet connection
  - It's an actual host
  - For example you can have 10 pods running that communicate through 8080 and there will be no conflicts
    - This is because each pod is it's own isolated virtual host
  - Container runtime is easily replaced (docker with containerd)
  - Multiple containers in a pod:
    - These are called helper or side application to main applications or "side-car" containers
    - Containers can talk via localhost and port, much like your local network and your laptop
  - "Pause" containers are in each pod
    - also called "sandbox" container
    - They reserve and hold network namespace (netns)
    - Enables communication between containers inside a pod
  - If the container dies it will be recreated with the same address, however if the pod dies it will be recreated with a different IP address.

## Pod to Pod Communication

- No built in solution
- K8s expects the dev to implement a network solution
- However, k8s has fundamental requirements on any implementation to be plugged into k8s
- The requirements are called Container Networking Interface or CNI
- CNI
  - Much like CRI
  - Requirements:
    - Every pod get its own unique IP
    - Pods on the same node can communicate with that IP
    - Pods on different nodes can communicate with that IP without a NAT
    - K8s expects that all pods to be able to communicate with all pods on the k8s NAT
    - 3rd party K8s Network Model Plugins
      - flannel
      - weaveworks
      - cilium
      - vmware NSX
- How does this work?
  - Each node gets an IP from the IP range of the VPC or subnet
  - Nodes belong to the same private network or LAN
  - Each node then creates it's own private network inside the node
    - This network must be different than the private network the node sits on to avoid overlapping
    - Ex:
      - Node sits on 172.31.0.0/16 the network inside the Node is 10.32.1.0/24 (this is the network the pods will sit on.)
    - A bridge (switch) then sits inside each node to for the pods to communicate with each other.
  - How do we create this network in the node?
    - The plugin create a CIDR block and then gives each node an equal subset of the block for the pods to communicate on.
    - Pods in different nodes can communicate via Gateways
      - Ex:
        - App pod (10.32.1.10) in Node 1 (172.31.1.10) wants to talk to DB pod (10.32.3.15) on Node 3 (172.31.1.12)
        - App pod will use Node 3's gateway (172.31.1.12) to talk with the other DB pod
        - The network plugin creates all the routes and tables across the entire Node network.
    - Network plugin is installed on each of the nodes
      - The plug in consists of "peers" (routers) that sit on the nodes
      - They for a group that can directly talk to each other.

## Installing WeaveWorks

- In home directory, run  ```wget "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$(kubectl version | base64 | tr -d '\n')" -O weave.yml```
- Default CIDR range is 10.32.0.0/12
  - You can change the CIDR range with ```--ipalloc-range=<subnet>```
- To apply config run ```kubectl apply -f weave.yml```
- To check if IPs have changed, run ```kubectl get pod -n kube-system -o wide```
