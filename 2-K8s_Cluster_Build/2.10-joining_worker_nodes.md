# Joining Worker Nodes

- To join worker nodes, you need to create a token for the worker nodes to use to connect to the master node's API server.
- To do this, run ```kubeadm token create --print-join-command``` on the master node
- This will create a new token as well as print the command to run on the worker nodes.
- Remember to open port 6783 for Weave to communicate with other nodes.
