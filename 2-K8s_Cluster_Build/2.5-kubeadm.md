# Kubeadm

## How does it work?

- Install kubeadm on each node
- Execute ```kubeadm init``` once
- Creates the all of the configuration:
  - Generates ```/etc/kubernetes``` directory
  - Generates a self-signed CA to set up identities for each component
  - Put generated certs inside
  - Generates static pod manifest files into ```/etc/kubernetes/manifests```
    - kubelete will detect these manifests and start the pods with suffix of hostname
  - Makes all necessary configurations
  - Remember kubeadm doesn't manage kubelet, so kubelet needs to be installed as well. 
  - We also want to interact with the cluster, so we need kubectl as well.

## Install Kubeadm

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl

sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl

service kubelet status
kubeadm
kubectl
```

## Kubeadm Initialization

- Run: ```sudo kubeadm init```
- Phases:
  - preflight
    - checks to validate the system state before making changes
    - pulls the images needed to setup the K8s cluster
  - certs
    - generating the needed certs in ```/etc/kubernetes/pki/```
  - kubeconfig
    - writes kubeconfig files in ```/etc/kubernetes/```
    - for kubelet, controller-manager and scheduler uses to connect ot the API server.
    - as well as kubeconfig file for administration
  - kubelet-start
