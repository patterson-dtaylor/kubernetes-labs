# Container Runtime

## Why do we need Container Runtime?

- ALL apps are ran as containers in K8s.
  - Even K8s components on both master and worker nodes are apps which run as containers.
- K8s created a generic interface that can run any Container Runtime (docker, containerd, cri-o) named Container Runtime Interface (CRI)
- CRI
  - Set of rules of what a container runtime must implement
- CRI and Docker
  - When CRI expanded to pull in containerd and cri-o, Docker did not implement the new CRI rules, so dockershim was created (a bridge for Docker to CRI).
  - However, with updated versions of K8s, CRI has now deprecated dockershim and Docker is not the most popular Container Runtime.
  - That crown is held by containerd which is ran on all major cloud providers (EKS)
  - Downside: no Docker commands anymore but can use K8s level and tools.

## Installing containerd

```bash
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/k8s.conf
overlay
br_netfilter
EOF

sudo modprobe overlay
sudo modprobe br_netfilter

cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables  = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.ipv4.ip_forward                 = 1
EOF

sudo sysctl --system

sudo apt update
sudo apt install containerd -y

sudo mkdir -p /etc/containerd
containerd config default | sudo tee /etc/containerd/config.toml
sudo systemctl restart containerd

service containerd status
```
