# Connecting to the Cluster with kubeconfig & kubectl

## How do we access the cluster once configured?
 - API server is the entrypoint
 - Kubeadm generated client certs
 - Kubeconfig file provides api server address, client cert, and client private key
 - We use kubeconfig to connect to the server through the CLI tool: kubectl
 - In other words:
   - kubectl: commands to connect to the cluster
   - kubeconfig: authenticates with the cluster

## Kubeconfig file

- Contains
  - cluster
    - cert
    - endpoint to api
  - users
    - list of users
    - defines client creds for auth to cluster
      - client cert
      - client key
  - contexts
    - list of contexts
    - used to group access params under a name
    - by default, kubectl uses current-context to communicate with the cluster
    - a bridge from users to the cluster

## Setting Kubeconfig file

1. use the set with the flag ```--kubeconfig```
   1. must use every time with kubectl
2. switch to root user and set as an environment variable with ```KUBECONFIG```
   1. not persistent
3. store config in a file on the ```$HOME/.kube/config``` directory
   1. best way for ease of use and persistance
